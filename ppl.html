                        <p>
                            The Princeton University Ping Pong League is a semester-based ping pong league geared towards Princeton University graduates and undergraduates interested in playing casual ping pong matches and competing for nothing else other than the fun and the potential of meeting fellow students through weekly matches. No fee is required for participation and students from any residential college can sign up for competing.  
                        </p>
                        <h2 style="font-size: 2em">Rules and Format:</h2>
                        <p>
                            All preliminary round matches are Best of 3, with each set being the first to 21. Serves alternate every 5 points.
                            </p>
                            <p>
A victory counts for 1 point and a loss counts for 0 points. Tie breaker criteria: A) Net sets won by the players, B) Total sets won by the players.</p>
<p>
Leaderboard, matchups and results of each round will be announced on the Ping Pong League's Official Website. It is the players' responsibility to contact each other to arrange a time and place for their match and report the results to the administrator Yannis Karakozis via email at ick@princeton.edu. Both players should report the result of the match to the administrator to ensure that the correct outcome of the match is registered.
</p>
<p>
In the case that a match is not played or the players do not inform the administrator by email, the result will be registered as (0-0) and each player will be penalized with a penalty point. A player with 3 penalty points will be kicked out of the league.
</p>
<p>
If a player cannot play, it is considered a forfeit (2-0) in favor of their opponent. No penalty points will be accrued in the case of a forfeit.
